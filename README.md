# Userscripts
**SteamNV** - Steam NSFW Verification, a userscript to automatically verify the Steam age verification, and/or comply with the NSFW warning subpage, for the Steam store and Community Hub. When a date of birth has not been specified by the user, this userscript will both generate and fill in a birth date automatically. These warnings are generally given when a game, or software, contains tags and content that either are not appropriate for all ages or inappropriate to be viewed at a workplace (e.g. at an office). Such reasons could be due to e.g. excessive or frequent violence, gore, excessive use foul language or (general) mature content.
