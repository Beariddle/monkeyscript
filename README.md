# Monkeyscript
Monkey patched userscripts to be used with addons/extensions such as [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) and [FireMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firemonkey/).

# Userscripts
#### [SteamNV](https://github.com/Beariddle/monkeyscript/blob/main/steamnv.user.js): Steam NSFW Verification. A userscript to automatically verify the Steam age verification, and/or, comply with the NSFW warning subpage for the Steam store and Community Hub. However, when a date of birth has not been specified by the user, this userscript will both generate and fill in a birth date automatically.

_These warnings are given when a game, or software, contains tags and content that either are not appropriate for all ages to view or inappropriate to be viewed at a workplace. Such reasons could be due to e.g. frequent violence, gore, excessive use foul language or (general) mature content._
